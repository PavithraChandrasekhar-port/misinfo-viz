              Misinformation has increasingly become a pervasive issue that traverses social media platforms. Organizations like 
              Boom Live, Logical Indian and India Today are IFCN certified fact-checking websites that debunks information. 
            <p>
              This investigation analyzed and presents
              recurring patterns in 3500+ claims from these organizations.

            <h5 class="total">Emerging Themes</h5>
            <p>
              The analysis revealed 15+ key-words that were recurring frequently. It was possible to identify underlying themes within these terms 
              and categorize them into four main categories. The themes were COVID-19, Politicians, Protests and Muslims.

            <p>
              "COVID-19", "Coronavirus", "COVID-19 Vaccine" were frequently occuring words in 2020-2021.</p>

             <p> COVID-19 has triggered mass misinformation within India. The public health misinformation
              does considerable damage to the people causing panic and misleading the public to adopt 
              practices that are harmful in times of a crisis. </p>

            <h5 class="total">Breakdown of patterns: Politicians</h5> 
            <p>
            Politicians contributed to 14% of overall claims in which close to 50 claims were about "Rahul Gandhi".
            "Narendra Modi" and "BJP" contributed to 10% of the misinformation within the given corpus.

            <p>
              BJP President, "Amit Shah" had previously <a href="https://thewire.in/politics/amit-shah-bjp-fake-social-media-messages"> said</a> that his party workers are capable of delivering
              any message to the public, true or fake.

          <div class="text-area">
            <h5 class="total">Breakdown of patterns: Protests</h5>
            <p>
              112 out of 530 claims in 2021 was about "Farmers", "Farmers Protest" or "Protest"
              The government has a history of shutting down protests and dissenting voices against the government
              in the guise of misinformation. This happened recently with the <a href= "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-blocks-then-restores-content-calling-on-indian-prime-minister-modi-to-resign-11619652354"> COVID-19 surge </a> and the <a href = "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/09/twitter-concerned-for-staff-in-india-after-row-over-account-removals">farmers protest.</a> 
              </p> 
              <p>
              However, by hovering over the graphs in this section you can notice that the misinformation that is circulated in this category is usually 
              about the protest itself and not the cause of the protest.

          <div class="text-area">
            <h5 class="total">Breakdown of patterns: Anti-Muslim</h5>
            <p>
              "Muslim" is a frequently occuring key word in misinformation. Anti-muslim misinformation has led to <a href = "https://caravanmagazine.in/religion/delhi-violence-north-east-maujpur-jaffrabad-babarpur-muslims-hindu">killing of muslims within the country.</a>
              The misinformation against muslims is a form of hate speech that accelerates the existing deep-seated prejudice against muslims and islamaphobia.

          Cookies are not inherently malicious. Often they are necessary for
          functionality that impacts your experience on the web in positive
          ways. However, when unknown third parties with unrecognizable names
          store cookies on your computer for up to 100 years with the sole
          purpose of tracking your online activity and serving targeted
          advertisements, we should be concerned about privacy on the web.

          every time you visit a new site. However, most companies in the US are
          doing the bare minimum to provide transparency on their cookie usage.
          The EU continues to lead the charge and will potentially provide more
          clarity on cookies consent in an

          published in Smashing Magazine, addressed issues surrounding cookies
          and tracking consent from a nuanced design perspective. In an ideal
          state, all websites that use your data would provide cookie management
          settings which allow users to see the purpose and expiration of every
          cookie. Additionally, the ability to toggle different cookies on and
          off would provide complete consent, but that obviously is not in the
          best interest of advertisers who want to place a lot of lengthy
          third-party tracking cookies on your computer.

        <p>
          If you're concerned like I was after my research, one of the easiest
          steps you can take is to turn off third-party cookies. Every major
          browser has this option. Safari already has third-party cookies
          disabled by default and Firefox will be disabling them by default in

          users<sup>[4]</sup>, you most likely use Chrome, which does not block
          them by default. You can manually block third-party cookies by
